Read me before running the main.R script

IMPORTANT: An API key is needed to run this script, available via the communal OpenAI account

OpenAI API key
The Github repo does not contain a file named "accesskey.txt" which contains the OpenAI APIkey.The file and the key contained therein is not meant to be shared and hence its absence from the repo. If you would like to run the code yourself, create a file named "accesskey.txt" in the working directory of your project and paste there the current active API key from the communal OpenAI account.
